# Snake Game User Guide

## Project Overview
Hey Prof Gio! So, I created a Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. It’s a classic game，you input commands by clicking the movement keys, and the little snake will move according to your instructions.

## Game Rules
1. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - Up arrow: move up
   - Down arrow: move down
   - Left arrow: move left
   - Right arrow: move right
2. Try to eat the yellow food that pops up on the screen. Every time you eat it, the snake gets longer!
3. If you hit the edges of the screen or run into your own tail, it’s game over.
4. If you do lose, you can press 'C' to keep playing or 'Q' to quit.

## A Quick Note
- The game window is set to 600x400 pixels.
- The snake moves at a speed of 15 blocks per second.
